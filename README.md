# *Object.lua*
An simple oop wrapper for oop programming originally made by @a327ex
First of all give this guy [game](https://github.com/a327ex/SNKRX) a star is well deserved! or buy his game for a couple of bucks on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/915310/SNKRX/) to support this developer.

If you're seeing this is problably because a library of mine uses it and
> There's always a relevant [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/2347/) for it.

## Features
- VERY VERY MINIMAL API
- MAKES OOP ON LUA COOL

## To do:
Pretty much nothing as of writing of this, it does pretty much all my oop needs. But may diverge from the original some time on the future; only time will tell...

## Getting started
1. ðŸ“¡ Get a copy of srt.lua from the [This Repository](https://github.com/alejandro-alzate/Object.lua).

2. ðŸ’¾ Copy `Object.lua` where you like to use it, or just on the root directory of the project.

3. âš™ Generally my libraries that require it as long they are not sandboxed or they can see the global `Object` they immediatly should pick up on it, else they'll try to require `Object` in the same folder.

4. ðŸ’Ž `require()` it and Profit.
